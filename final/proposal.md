# Proposal

## Description

For the final project, I want to develop a simple VR board game by using A-Frame that can be played on Desktop, and Smartphones. For example, a [Go](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Go_(game))/[Gomoku](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Gomoku) that is played in three dimensions! The player can win by making five in a row not only on one surface but seven surfaces, which adds to thousands of possibilities. 

## Instruments

1. ~~[A-Frame](https://aframe.io/), a Web Framework that Makes WebVR with HTML and Entity-Component Works on Vive, Rift, Daydream, GearVR, desktop~~  
   (not used eventually)
2. [three.js](https://threejs.org/) for the VR engine, a cross-browser JavaScript library and Application Programming Interface (API) used to create and display animated 3D computer graphics in a web browser.
